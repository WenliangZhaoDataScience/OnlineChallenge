Tested on
System: x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0 (OS 10.9.2)
compiler: c++ 4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40)

For test funning:
  bash ./test_run.sh
which compile the class with a program called test_run.cpp. Tests are reading inputs from a text file (set), separated by spaces (only read non-spaces keys and values); print current load after reading; get one value from key "JJ" (if not in map, print not find); remove one entry called "Mary"; add back "Mary" with value 100. In the end, clean all objects and binary files.
